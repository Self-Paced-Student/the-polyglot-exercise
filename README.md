# The polyglot

Today you’ll become familiar with 3 new programming languages: Ruby, Python, and C.

Learning other programming languages is fun, and the more languages you learn, the easier it gets to learn new ones. It’s even easier than with human languages, since programming languages are more similar to each other.

Every section of this exercise is composed of a tutorial and some practice. It’s a good idea to go through the tutorial individually, and then sync with your pair to do the coding part together.

Before starting, check how many hours you have available in total for this exercise. Then divide them in 3 equal sections, one for each language, and set timers making sure you switch to the new section when the time comes.

### Ruby

Complete the [Learn Ruby](https://www.learnrubyonline.org/) tutorial.

Once you’re done, solve the [Highest Word Count](https://github.com/codeworksbcn/tp-highest-word-count) problem using Ruby. As a tip, notice that you don’t need [Lodash](https://lodash.com/). Can you see why?

### Python

Read the [Learn Python](https://www.learnpython.org/) tutorial.

Ok, now solve the [Evented Thing](https://github.com/codeworksbcn/tp-evented-thing) problem using Python.

### C

Finally go through the [Learn C](https://www.learn-c.org/) tutorial.

Now start playing with some Arduino code! Check out the examples [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BuiltInExamples). Begin with the first one, and once you understand how it works feel free to move to something more complicated. Your fantasy is the limit!

First build your code on the [Arduino Web Editor](https://create.arduino.cc/) to simulate if it works properly (you’ll need to create an account). Then, if you want to see your machine in flesh and bones, ask an instructor to show where we keep Arduino parts around campus (just put everything back where it was once you’re done).

## Getting started

Feel free to use your usual code editor for the exercises, with the files you find in the `/code` folder.

To run your code on Arduino you’ll then need to compile the file from the command line, or by copy / pasting its content in the Arduino IDE.

## Extra credits

- Can you figure out how to write unit tests for your code in each language?

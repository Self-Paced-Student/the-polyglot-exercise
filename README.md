# The polyglot

Today you’ll become familiar with 3 new programming languages: Ruby, Python, and C.

Learning other programming languages is fun, and the more languages you learn, the easier it gets to learn new ones. It’s even easier than with human languages, since programming languages are more similar to each other.

Every section of this exercise is composed of a tutorial and some practice.

Divide your time so that you spend 3 hours on each language, of which max 90 minutes on the tutorial part. By the way, it’s probably a good idea to do the tutorial by yourself, and the exercise in pair.

### Ruby

How far you can get in the [Try Ruby](http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0) tutorial?

Once you’re done, re-implement the first half of [Underline](https://github.com/codeworksbcn/pre-course/tree/master/underline) using Ruby.

### Python

Read the [Learn Python](https://www.learnpython.org/) tutorial.

Ok, now you’re ready to complete the missing part of [Underline](https://github.com/codeworksbcn/pre-course/tree/master/underline) in Python.

### C

Finally go through the [Learn C](https://www.learn-c.org/) tutorial.

Now start playing with some Arduino code! Check out the examples [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BuiltInExamples). Begin with the first one, and once you understand how it works feel free to move to something more complicated. Your fantasy is the limit!

Yo can use the Arduino parts you find around campus (just put everything back where you’ve found it once you’re done), or the [Arduino Web Editor](https://create.arduino.cc/) to simulate your code.

## Getting started

Feel free to use your usual code editor for the exercises, with the files you find in the `/code` folder.

To run your code on Arduino you’ll then need to compile the file from the command line, or by copy / pasting its content in the Arduino IDE.

## Extra credits

- Can you figure out how to write unit tests for your code in each language?

# Define the "EventedThing" class, so that its instances have
# an "on" and a "trigger" method to react to events. For example:
#
# eventedThing.on('meet', function (name) {
#  console.log('Nice to meet you, ' + name + '.');
# });
#
# eventedThing.trigger('meet', 'Sarah');
# -> 'Hi there!'
# -> 'Nice to meet you, Sarah.'
#
# eventedThing.trigger('whatever');
# -> nothing happens

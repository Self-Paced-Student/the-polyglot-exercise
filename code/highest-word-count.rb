# Write a function that given a string returns an array containing
# the most frequent word in it. If the top frequency is shared by more than
# one word, the array will contain all of them (the order is not relevant).
# Your implementation should exclude anything that is not a word
# (e.g. punctuation and numbers)
# If the input is an empty string, return an empty array.
# If the input is not a string, an error should be thrown.
# TIP: You'll need to use a regex.
